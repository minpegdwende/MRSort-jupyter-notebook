A single peaked (resp. single-valley) preference is characterized by 2 profiles values forming an interval, for which within itself, the evaluations account for the *good* (resp. *bad*) values, while outside the interval, evaluations are labeled as *bad* (resp. *good*) values. Comparably good values for a gain (resp. cost) criterion are located above (resp. below) the profile value of such criterion.\n",
